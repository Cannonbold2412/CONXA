## What This Is

Conxa is an AI-native automation platform. SaaS companies record browser workflows in the Build Studio (Electron + Python, Windows), compile them into structured skill packages with multi-signal element identity and self-healing recovery, publish them to the Conxa Cloud, and distribute them to end customers as `.exe` installers that run via Claude Desktop's MCP protocol. Execution is entirely local on the customer's machine — the cloud is coordination infrastructure, not an execution environment.

Three systems, three owners:

```
Company (SaaS vendor)        Conxa Cloud              Customer (end user)
─────────────────────        ───────────              ──────────────────
Build Studio (Windows)  →    Render + Vercel      →   Runtime (Claude Desktop)
Record + compile locally     Proxy / host / bill      Execute locally via MCP
```

## Documentation — Read First

The `docs/` folder is the authoritative source of truth for this codebase. Before making non-trivial changes, read the relevant doc rather than inferring from code alone.

| Doc | Read it when… |
|---|---|
| [`docs/TRD.md`](docs/TRD.md) | Touching the recorder, compiler, runtime, auth flows, API surface, or recovery cascade. This is the authoritative technical deep-dive: architecture, all auth flows with sequence diagrams, pipeline stages, data contracts, security model, known gaps. |
| [`docs/App-Flow.md`](docs/App-Flow.md) | Changing how a user flow works end-to-end — onboarding, record, compile, build, install, execute, update. |
| [`docs/Backend-Schema.md`](docs/Backend-Schema.md) | Changing data models, adding API endpoints, modifying KV namespaces, or changing telemetry event schemas. Contains ERD diagrams and full API contracts with request/response examples. |
| [`docs/UI-UX-Brief.md`](docs/UI-UX-Brief.md) | Changing any screen in the Build Studio or Cloud Dashboard. Documents every screen's purpose, inputs, outputs, and known UX issues. |
| [`docs/Implementation-Plan.md`](docs/Implementation-Plan.md) | Starting on a new engineering task. Contains the prioritised 4-phase roadmap with specific files to change and risk assessments per item. |
| [`docs/PRD.md`](docs/PRD.md) | Understanding product goals, personas, positioning, or long-term strategy. **Do not edit for individual features** — see doc maintenance rules below. |
| [`docs/cost_model.md`](docs/cost_model.md) | Making decisions that affect LLM usage at compile or execution time. |
| [`docs/Security.md`](docs/Security.md) | Touching auth, RBAC, billing, or any security-sensitive surface. Numbered gap tracker (SG-01…) with fix status, cross-referenced from `docs/TRD.md` §15/§17. |
| [`docs/Sales-Blockers.md`](docs/Sales-Blockers.md) | Checking what's still blocking an enterprise sale. Sales-framed view of the same Phase 1/2 checklist tracked in `docs/Implementation-Plan.md`. |
| [`docs/Auth-and-Updater.md`](docs/Auth-and-Updater.md) | Touching Build Studio auth (Clerk PKCE), runtime auth (per-company sync token), or either auto-updater (Build Studio electron-updater, runtime manifest-driven self-update). |
| [`SHIP-GUIDE.md`](SHIP-GUIDE.md) | Shipping a release — dev/prod promotion workflow, channel tagging, runtime host/app versioning. |
| [`research-analysis/07-go-to-market/agentic-discovery-strategy.md`](research-analysis/07-go-to-market/agentic-discovery-strategy.md) | Understanding how multi-agent skill discovery and the durability flywheel are gated and governed. |
| [`docs/archive/`](docs/archive/) | Looking for historical context only — superseded reports and rotated `FIX.md` logs. Not current guidance. Includes `docs/archive/refactors/PHASE_4_REFACTOR_REPORT.md`, which documents a failed approach to splitting `config.py` — read it before attempting that refactor again. |
| [`TODO.md`](TODO.md) | Picking up new engineering work. The single prioritized backlog spanning documentation, architecture, and every subsystem. |

## Design Context

Two UI surfaces each carry their own `PRODUCT.md` (strategic: register, users, positioning, brand personality) and `DESIGN.md` (visual: colors, typography, components) for the `/impeccable` design skill. Read the relevant pair before any non-trivial UI change in that app.

| Surface | Register / Platform | Files |
|---|---|---|
| Cloud dashboard + marketing site | brand / web | [`conxa-cloud/frontend/PRODUCT.md`](conxa-cloud/frontend/PRODUCT.md), [`conxa-cloud/frontend/DESIGN.md`](conxa-cloud/frontend/DESIGN.md) |
| Build Studio (Electron renderer) | product / web | [`conxa-builder/electron/renderer/PRODUCT.md`](conxa-builder/electron/renderer/PRODUCT.md), [`conxa-builder/electron/renderer/DESIGN.md`](conxa-builder/electron/renderer/DESIGN.md) |

## Working Principles

1. **Think before coding.** State assumptions. If multiple interpretations exist, surface them — don't silently pick one. If a simpler approach exists, call it out. If something is unclear, stop and ask.
2. **Simplicity first.** Write the minimum code needed. No speculative abstractions, no configurability for single-use code, no handling for impossible scenarios. If 200 lines could be 50, rewrite it.
3. **Surgical changes.** Touch only what the task requires. Don't refactor unrelated code; mention issues rather than fixing them. Match existing style. Every changed line must trace to the task. If your changes leave unused code, remove only what *you* introduced.
4. **Goal-driven.** Define success → implement → verify. Bug → reproduce → fix → verify. Refactor → ensure no behavior change.

### Token and file constraints

- Don't read files larger than ~25 KB completely. Use `offset`/`limit`, or `grep`/`tail` to find the relevant chunk first.
- Session artifacts (`data/sessions/<id>/events.jsonl`, screenshots, compile reports) can be very large — always scope reads.

## Common Commands

### Developer setup (first-time)

```powershell
# Windows — run once after cloning
.\scripts\setup.ps1
```

```bash
# macOS / Linux — run once after cloning
./scripts/setup.sh
```

Both scripts install: conxa-core, Build Studio Python deps, Playwright Chromium, Electron node_modules, runtime node_modules.

After setup, start the dev server:

```bash
cd conxa-builder/electron && npm run dev
```

### Cloud backend

```bash
# Install shared foundation first (editable for dev), then cloud deps
pip install -e packages/conxa-core
cd conxa-cloud/backend && pip install -r requirements.txt   # or ./build.sh (used by Render)

# Run the API server (no Playwright — cloud does not record or compile)
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
# start.sh runs the same without --reload, binding to $PORT

# Tests — run from conxa-cloud/
# pytest.ini puts backend, conxa-builder/python, and packages/conxa-core on the path
cd .. && pytest -q tests

# Compile tools require conxa_compile on PYTHONPATH
PYTHONPATH=../conxa-builder/python python scripts/recompile_session.py <session_id>
PYTHONPATH=../conxa-builder/python python scripts/test_plugin.py <plugin-slug> --skip-phase2 --skip-phase5
```

### Build Studio backend (local pipeline)

```bash
pip install -e packages/conxa-core
cd conxa-builder/python && pip install -r requirements.txt && python -m playwright install chromium
python backend.py   # stdio JSON-RPC backend — normally spawned by Electron, not run directly
```

### Cloud frontend

```bash
cd conxa-cloud/frontend
npm install
npm run dev       # local dev server
npm run lint      # eslint
npm run build     # production build (Vercel)
```

### Runtime (Node.js MCP)

```bash
cd runtime
npm install
npm start                     # node server.js — MCP stdio mode
npm run build:win             # @yao-pkg/pkg → dist/runtime-win.exe
npm run build:mac             # @yao-pkg/pkg → dist/runtime-mac
```

### Configuration

Copy `.env.example` → `.env`. All backend settings use the `SKILL_` env prefix — see `packages/conxa-core/conxa_core/config.py`. LLM provider keys feed the multi-provider router — see `conxa-cloud/backend/ROUTER_SETUP.md`. Groq, Google AI Studio, and NVIDIA NIM are enabled by default.

---

## Architecture

The full technical reference — pipeline stages, runtime filesystem layout, all auth flows, recovery cascade tiers, API surface, and known gaps — is in **[`docs/TRD.md`](docs/TRD.md)**. Read it before touching the recorder, compiler, or runtime.

Quick orientation:

- **Build Studio** (`conxa-builder/python/conxa_compile/`): `bridge.js` → `session.py` → `pipeline/run.py` → `compiler/build.py` → `skill_package_builder.py`. All local. Cloud is not involved. Compiler uses `IdentityBundle` as sole identity source on the primary compile path — LLM writes selector strings only via the 1-click fix API's re-compile path (see Key Invariants); otherwise LLM is limited to intent, vision anchors, recovery, and the intent graph.
- **Cloud** (`conxa-cloud/`): coordination only — LLM proxy, skill pack hosting, telemetry ingest, billing. Does not record, compile, or execute.
- **Runtime** (`runtime/`): two-layer architecture on the customer's machine.
  - **Host exe** (`@yao-pkg/pkg`, built `--no-bytecode`): bundles `bootstrap.js` + `_pkg_stubs.js` only. Provides `__hostRequire` so disk-loaded app code can use Playwright etc. Built with `build-runtime-host.yml`, tagged `host-vX.Y.Z`.
  - **App layer** (`conxa-app/`, disk-resident at `~/.conxa/conxa-app/`): contains `server.js`, `run.js`, `resolver.js`, `resolve_adapter.js`, `recovery.js` and the rest. Obfuscated JS, independently updatable without reinstalling the host exe. `bootstrap.js` enforces `min_host` semver before loading. Built with `build-runtime-app.yml`, tagged `app-vX.Y.Z`. Versioned-directory rollback (via `version_manager.js`) on failed update. Studio sandbox (`sandbox/.conxa/`) mirrors this layout for local workflow tests.

MCP tools exposed by `runtime/server.js`: `execute_skill`, `execute_sequence`, `list_skills`, `get_skill_inputs`, `get_execution_status`, `cancel_execution`, `get_runtime_status`. There is no `refresh_skills` tool. Concurrency (RT-3, 2026-08-22): several runs may be active at once (separate chats, or several `execute_skill` calls in one chat) — see `runtime/app/run_registry.js` and `docs/TRD.md` §4.5. `execute_skill`/`execute_sequence` are admitted up to `CONXA_MAX_CONCURRENT_RUNS` (default 5); `cancel_execution` takes an optional `run_id`, required once more than one run is active. Two runs touching the SAME external platform (e.g. both hitting Render) still serialize against each other via `runtime/app/host_lock.js` — runtime-internal isolation alone doesn't protect the platform's own application layer from concurrent writes; runs on different platforms stay fully parallel.

## Where to Look First

| Concern | Code path |
|---|---|
| Recorder event types | `conxa_compile/recorder/bridge.js` → `pipeline/` → `compiler/build.py` → `runtime/run.js` |
| IdentityBundle / signal compilation | `conxa_compile/compiler/identity_bundle.py`, `selector_grammar.py`, `stable_hash.py` |
| Selector scoring / anchor quality | `conxa_compile/compiler/selector_score.py`, `selector_filters.py` (anchor quality gates) |
| Runtime element resolution | `runtime/resolver.js` (pure, unit-testable) + `runtime/resolve_adapter.js` (Playwright adapter) |
| Runtime recovery cascade | `runtime/recovery.js` — L1 exception ladder + L2 re-hover/a11y (Tier 1–2, zero tokens) |
| Assertions / outcome validation | `conxa_compile/compiler/validation_planner.py`; runtime `verifyAssertions()` in `run.js` |
| Skill package building | `conxa_compile/skill_package_builder.py` (data-only output, auth excluded) |
| LLM calls (compile side) | task clients in `conxa_compile/llm/` → `conxa_core.llm.get_router()` → cloud proxy |
| LLM provider pool (cloud) | `conxa-cloud/backend/app/llm/router.py` behind `POST /api/v1/llm/proxy/{text,vision}` |
| Frame / iframe handling | `docs/TRD.md` § "Iframe Pipeline"; `bridge.js`, `session.py`, `build.py`, `run.js` |
| Shared data models | `packages/conxa-core/conxa_core/models/` — SkillPackage, RecordedEvent, Workflow, SkillPack |
| Auth (Build Studio) | `conxa-builder/python/services/auth_service.py` — Clerk PKCE → OS keyring |
| Auth (Runtime) | `runtime/auth_manager.js` — per-company token in keytar; AES-256-GCM session |
| Auth (Cloud API) | `conxa-cloud/backend/app/api/security.py` — Clerk JWT via PyJWT + JWKS |
| Telemetry | `runtime/tracker.js` → `conxa-cloud/backend/app/api/tracking_routes.py` |
| Skill pack sync | `runtime/sync.js` ↔ `app/api/skillpack_update_routes.py` |
| MCP registration into agent hosts | `runtime/mcp_register.js` (`register-mcp`/`unregister-mcp` subcommands, dispatched from `bootstrap.js`) + `mcp_hosts.js`/`mcp_hosts_toml.js`/`mcp_hosts_yaml.js` (per-host tables) + `config_edit.js`/`config_edit_toml.js`/`config_edit_yaml.js` (atomic, ownership-checked writers) + `durable_context.js` (post-sync discoverability files) — see `docs/TRD.md` §4.2a |
| Runtime two-layer bootstrap | `runtime/bootstrap.js` — min_host check, app-layer load, `.bak` fallback |
| Host / app update manifests | `conxa-cloud/backend/app/api/updates_routes.py` (manifest_version 2; deps: `conxa-runtime`, `conxa-app`) |
| Studio sandbox for workflow tests | `conxa-builder/python/conxa_compile/conxa_runtime.py` — stages host exe + app layer under `sandbox/.conxa/` |
| CI execution gate | `runtime/test/gate_replay.js` + `runtime/test/gate-skill/` — real skill replay, **active** in both `build-runtime-host.yml` (vs. the freshly built exe) and `build-runtime-app.yml` (vs. the `MIN_HOST` exe). A red app-layer gate usually means `MIN_HOST` is stale, not that the gate is wrong |
| Frontend screens | `conxa-cloud/frontend/src/` — Dashboard, Skill Packages, Billing, Team, Settings |

## Deployment

**Cloud backend** runs on Render. Root directory: `conxa-cloud/backend`. `build.sh` installs `packages/conxa-core` then `requirements.txt`. `start.sh` runs `uvicorn app.main:app` (`init_db()` creates schema on startup). A `Dockerfile` exists (build context = repo root). `GET /readyz` gates deploys (DB ping); `GET /healthz` is liveness. With `SKILL_AUTH_REQUIRED=true` the app **refuses to start** unless `SKILL_DATABASE_URL`, Clerk issuer/JWKS, `CORS_ORIGINS`, Cashfree credentials, and at least one LLM provider key are set. No silent fallback to filesystem DB in production.

**Cloud frontend** runs on Vercel. Project root: `conxa-cloud/frontend`. Build: `npm run build`. The Next.js route handler `/api/v1/*` proxies to `API_ORIGIN`. Requires `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`.

**Runtime** ships as two artifacts embedded in the NSIS installer:
- **Host exe** (`dist/runtime-win.exe`): built with `--no-bytecode` so the Playwright selector engine works. Contains only `bootstrap.js` + `_pkg_stubs.js`. Tagged `host-vX.Y.Z`. Installed to `~/.conxa/` on Windows.
- **App layer** (`conxa-app/`): obfuscated JS bundle (`server.js`, `run.js`, `resolver.js`, etc.). Tagged `app-vX.Y.Z`. Staged beside the host exe at `~/.conxa/conxa-app/`. Independently updatable via cloud; `bootstrap.js` enforces `min_host` semver before loading it, and `version_manager.js` rolls back to the previous versioned directory on failure.

**The installer is a thin, static-config-only artifact for skill packs** — it stages only the company's `pack.json` (identity, `installer_version`, sync/tracking endpoints and tokens), never any skill file trees. After install, `runtime/sync.js`'s delta-sync (§Backend-Schema.md §5.9) downloads every skill and creates each skill's `current` junction on its own first run, exactly as it does for every later update. `{installer_version}` (a small Conxa-owned allow-list, e.g. `v1`/`v2`) is frozen into `pack.json` at build time and is never reassigned remotely — see `docs/Backend-Schema.md` §5.1a for the full versioned-endpoint scheme. Skill Pack Publishing (Build Studio's "Publish Skill Package" page) is the primary, mandatory, version-controlled release action; Build Installer is a secondary, advanced action that packages an already-published release and whose cloud upload is optional (a failed/skipped upload never fails the build).

Self-updates poll `/api/v1/updates/runtime-manifest` (manifest_version 2; deps keyed `conxa-runtime` + `conxa-app`). SHA-256 integrity required for both artifacts.

## Key Invariants

These are non-negotiable. Do not work around them.

- **Auth files never enter build output.** `auth/auth.json`, Playwright storageState, and credentials are local runtime state only. `skill_package_builder.py` enforces this — the check must remain.
- **Tier 1/2 recovery costs zero LLM tokens.** LLM fires at Tier 3+ only. Do not introduce silent LLM fallbacks into compiled-selector or a11y resolution paths. `recovery.js` implements L1/L2; `run.js` escalates to Tier 3+ only after both are exhausted.
- **Iframe chain is preserved verbatim** from recording through compile and execution. Bounding boxes are page-level (offsets accumulated up the parent chain in `session.py`).
- **`frame_enter` / `frame_exit` steps get `no_recovery_block`.** These are navigation markers, not interactable elements. They are never retried.
- **All API routes live under `/api/v1`.** The frontend and runtime both depend on this prefix. Do not route anything else there. **Documented permanent exception:** `tracking_routes.py`'s public telemetry-ingest endpoint is also served bare at `/api/tracking/{company}/events` (in addition to `/api/v1/tracking/...` and the versioned `/api/v1/workflows/{installer_version}/{company}/tracking/events`). This is a deliberate, permanent back-compat alias for already-deployed runtimes whose installer-baked `pack.json.tracking.tracking_url` points at the bare path — it cannot be removed without breaking those installs, and it is not sanctioned as a precedent for adding further routes outside `/api/v1` by analogy.
- **The cloud does not compile or execute.** Recording, compilation, skill package building, and skill execution are local-only. Keep them that way.
- **Host exe built `--no-bytecode`.** V8 bytecode (.jsc) masks the Node version and causes the Playwright selector engine to segfault in pkg-bundled binaries. Never re-enable bytecode for the host exe.
- **Resolver never blindly picks `candidate[0]`.** `resolver.js` requires the winning candidate's margin over the runner-up to clear `uniqueMargin` (default 0.15); otherwise it falls through to the next signal. Do not add shortcut paths that skip this gate.
- **LLM does not write selector strings on the primary compile path.** `IdentityBundle` + `selector_grammar.py` are the sole selector generators when a workflow is first compiled. LLM is retained for: per-step intent, relational vision anchors, recovery describe-then-match (Tier 3+), and the workflow intent graph. Two narrow, user-initiated re-compile exceptions exist, neither part of the primary compiler: the 1-click fix API (`compiler/patch.py::_regenerate_compiled_selectors`, via `llm/selector_regeneration.py`), which re-runs LLM-assisted selector generation against the original DOM snapshot when a user manually re-targets a step's element in the editor; and the Human Edit re-target wizard's "draw a new region" path (`editor/retarget.py` → `llm/region_selector_vision.py`, task `region_selector`), which uses a vision LLM — screenshot with the drawn region highlighted, plus the recorded DOM — because no recording stores per-element geometry a text prompt could resolve a drawn region against.
- **App-layer min_host is enforced at load time.** `bootstrap.js` reads `version.json` from `conxa-app/` and refuses to load if `min_host` > current host semver. Do not bypass this check when bumping the app layer.
- **MCP host-config editing lives only in the runtime, never in the installer.** `conxa-runtime.exe register-mcp`/`unregister-mcp` (`runtime/mcp_register.js` + `mcp_hosts*.js` + `config_edit*.js`) is the sole place that reads or writes an AI agent host's config file. NSIS invokes the subcommand and nothing more — do not reintroduce config-editing logic (PowerShell or otherwise) into `setup.nsi.tmpl`. This is what makes install and uninstall derive the registration key (`conxa` vs `conxa-dev`) from the same source instead of two values that can drift apart — see MCP-4 in `TODO.md` for the bug that shipped when they didn't.
- **One workspace has exactly one skill pack and one installer, forever.** `workspace_id` is the sole identity key for a SkillPack — there is no per-workspace multi-company concept. `company_slug` as a separately claimable, globally-unique identifier was removed (2026-08-21): KV namespaces (`skill_pack_meta`, `sync_tokens`, `tracking_tokens`), Clerk-authenticated dashboard routes (publish/release/groups/deployments), `pack.json`, and every subsystem (conxa-core, Build Studio, runtime, frontend) key off `workspace_id` directly. `conxa_core.workspace.workspace_dir_slug(workspace_id)` is a pure character-safety transform (filesystem/URL-safe), not an identity mechanism — never reintroduce a name-derived, separately-owned slug. Runtime-facing routes (sync delta, tracking ingest — bearer-token authenticated, no Clerk session) still carry `{workspace_id}` as a path segment for routing, but the bearer token is what actually authorizes the call. Deliberate, narrow exception (2026-08-21): `installer_builder.py::build_installer`'s `installer_name` param (a user-typed, unverified company domain, e.g. "acme.com") names that one installer's on-disk `skill-packs/<slug>/` folder and `.exe` filename via `workspace_dir_slug(domain)` — purely cosmetic, local to a single installer build. It is never written to any KV namespace, never used for auth or routing, and `workspace_id` remains the identity backing sync/tracking tokens and every cloud lookup; if this domain later needs to be a real identity key (e.g. cloud-side lookups by domain), that requires actual verification first, not just this cosmetic slug.
- **A step never executes on a tab other than the one it was recorded on.** `runtime/tabs.js::resolveStepPage` resolves each step's live page fresh, per step, from `SkillStep.tab`. If the recorded tab cannot be resolved (a site-opened tab that never opens, a closed tab that should still exist), the step fails — it never falls back to whatever page happens to be current. This is the tab twin of the frame-chain rule above: a same-looking element on the wrong tab is worse than a clean failure.

## Maintaining the Docs

The `docs/` files are living documentation. After making significant changes to the codebase, update the relevant doc so it stays accurate. A doc that drifts from the code is worse than no doc.

### Which doc to update after which changes

| Change type | Update |
|---|---|
| Architecture change — new system, new component, new communication path | `docs/TRD.md` |
| Auth flow change — new token type, new validation step, new storage | `docs/TRD.md` |
| New or changed API endpoint | `docs/TRD.md`, `docs/Backend-Schema.md` |
| Data model change — new field, new model, new KV namespace | `docs/Backend-Schema.md` |
| New telemetry event code | `docs/Backend-Schema.md` |
| Recovery cascade change — new tier, changed tier order or cost | `docs/TRD.md`, `docs/App-Flow.md` |
| User flow change — new screen, new step in an existing flow | `docs/App-Flow.md` |
| New screen or significant screen redesign | `docs/UI-UX-Brief.md` |
| Engineering task completed from the roadmap | `docs/Implementation-Plan.md` (mark done or update status) |
| New gap or tech debt identified | `docs/Implementation-Plan.md` |

### What does NOT require a doc update

- Bug fixes that do not change observable behavior or data contracts.
- Internal refactors that keep the same API surface and data models.
- Configuration changes, dependency version bumps.
- Test additions.

When in doubt, update the doc. A stale sentence in the TRD costs future engineers hours.

### FIX.md rotation

Keep appending to `FIX.md` after every prompt as usual. When `FIX.md` crosses a calendar-day boundary, rotate the completed portion into `docs/archive/fix-log/FIX-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` (one file per day, split by each entry's own trailing `— YYYY-MM-DD` date, not a blind line-number cut — entries aren't always strictly chronological top-to-bottom), add a row to `docs/archive/fix-log/INDEX.md`, and leave only the current entries live in `FIX.md`.

### TODO.md

`TODO.md` at the repo root is the single prioritized backlog spanning documentation, architecture, and every subsystem. When you complete an item from it, mark it done in place (don't delete it — strike it through with a resolution date, matching the pattern used in `docs/Sales-Blockers.md`/`docs/Security.md`). When you discover new, still-open work during a task, add it to `TODO.md` rather than leaving it undocumented.

### PRD update policy

**Do not edit `docs/PRD.md` for individual features, bug fixes, or incremental improvements.**

`docs/PRD.md` is a strategic document. It reflects the company's vision, product positioning, competitive analysis, and multi-year roadmap. It should only change when something fundamentally shifts at the company level:

- A new target market or customer segment is adopted.
- The business model changes (e.g., from per-skill-package to platform licensing).
- The distribution model changes significantly (e.g., moving beyond MCP).
- The core value proposition shifts (e.g., adding a cloud execution tier).
- A new phase is added to the roadmap after completing a major milestone.

For everything else — adding a feature, fixing a flow, shipping a phase — update the technical docs (`TRD.md`, `Backend-Schema.md`, `App-Flow.md`, `Implementation-Plan.md`) and leave the PRD alone.

After every prompt, add an entry to FIX.md summarizing what changed. Write it so a non-technical person (a founder, a salesperson, a new hire) understands it on first read — no jargon, no file paths, no function names, no acronyms.

Rules for each entry:
- 2-4 short sentences, plain words, one idea per sentence.
- Say what the problem was (in real-world terms — "the button did nothing when clicked", not "handler was unbound"), what changed, and why it matters to a user.
- Use an analogy if it helps ("like a light switch that was wired to the wrong bulb").
- No code names, class names, or filenames. If you must reference a screen or feature, use its plain product name (e.g., "the Publish page", not `publish.py`).
- End with a one-line "— YYYY-MM-DD" date, as today.

Example entry:
> **Fixed the workflow editor freezing when renaming a step — 2026-07-16**
> Renaming a step in the editor used to lock up the screen. Now it saves instantly. This was breaking anyone trying to fix typos in their recorded workflows.

Bad entry (too technical — do not do this):
> Fixed race condition in `patch.py::_regenerate_compiled_selectors` where debounce wasn't awaited.
