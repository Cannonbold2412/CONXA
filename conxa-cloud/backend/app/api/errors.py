"""One error response shape for every route, with a human-readable message and a
request id every failure can be traced to a log line by.

Additive, not a replacement: ``detail`` keeps carrying exactly what each
``raise HTTPException(..., detail=...)`` call site already sent — both a bare
string code and the one dict-valued ``llm_all_providers_failed`` body (see
llm_proxy_routes.py) — because it is a real wire contract two shipped clients
parse directly: the frontend's ``apiBase.ts`` and Build Studio's
``services/llm_proxy_client.py`` (LLMProxyClient._post reads
``error_body.get("detail")`` and does string/dict inspection on it). Neither
gets touched by this change. ``message`` and ``request_id`` are new, additive
fields a client may use instead.
