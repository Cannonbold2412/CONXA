"""Tests for compiler/date_picker.py's click-run collapse — previously untested (7969ad8 added
only runtime/test/unit/test_date_picker.js, the pure replay math; the compile-side collapse
pass itself had zero Python coverage).

Covers the two defects found chasing the demoqa.com/automation-practice-form Date of Birth
picker failure (the failing step there was actually a fabricated accessible-name bug in
identity_bundle.py — see test_nameless_element_identity.py — but this module has its own,
separate defects that were never exercised by any recording old enough to hit them):

- _looks_like_field_open must match a `focus`-action opener (clean_steps rewrites a plain
  click on an editable target to `action=focus` before this pass ever runs — a click-only
  check can never fold the common case).
- strategy is derived from whether an anchored field exists (handler_hints.date_picker.open),
  not from whether a preceding step happened to fold — those are different questions.
- no compiled date_pick step carries a value_equals assertion pinned to the recorded date
  (that made every run with a caller-supplied date fail VERIFY even after a correct pick).
