"""workflow_review (BUILD-26 merge, wiring fixed BUILD-29) — the compiler's one whole-workflow
LLM call, decided by conxa_core.llm.client.VISION_TASKS / _openai_messages_for_task /
_openai_body_dict.

Before BUILD-29, the task name was missing from all three of those, so it silently fell through
to the no-system-prompt default and was routed to the text model — meaning every compile ran
rules-only, with no error anywhere. Mirrors test_copilot_llm_task.py's pattern: assert the
registration and prompt content directly, not just end-to-end behavior.
