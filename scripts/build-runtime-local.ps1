.SYNOPSIS
  Build the real runtime host exe locally and drop it exactly where a real
  download would — so Test Skill uses the identical code path as Production.
  Dev only — never touches Production.

.DESCRIPTION
  Mirrors build-runtime-host.yml exactly: runs the same pre-build guards
  (check_pkg_stubs.js, check_host_manifest.js — the checks that catch "works in
  dev, breaks inside the packaged exe"), stamps runtime/package.json's version
  and host_version (plus ed25519_public_key from CONXA_MANIFEST_PUBLIC_KEY when
  that env var is set, matching CI's repo variable), then runs
  `npm run build:win` (pkg, --no-bytecode) — but on your own machine, writing
  straight into
  <CONXA_STUDIO_HOME>\deps\conxa-runtime\<version>\ instead of publishing a
  GitHub Release. package.json is restored to its original, committed content
  afterward — this never leaves a stamped version in the working tree.

  This is the SAME folder conxa_compile/conxa_runtime.py's _bootstrap_runtime_dir()
  scans in Production (after a real download) — Test Skill's resolve_runtime_dir()
  and ensure_test_sandbox() do not know or care whether what's there was
  downloaded or built locally; the code path is identical. Only CONXA_STUDIO_HOME
  differs between Dev and Production, keeping them isolated.

  Any other version already under deps\conxa-runtime\ is deleted first, so
  there's always exactly one — deterministic, and avoids competing with a real
  download that might land there too (e.g. from clicking "Build Installer").

  Run this after editing bootstrap.js (the pkg entry point), version_manager.js,
  or env.js — anything the host exe itself statically bundles. For everything
  else (server.js, run.js, resolver.js, recovery.js, ...), use
  build-app-local.ps1 instead — those files are loaded from disk at runtime,
  not baked into the exe.

  .\scripts\build-runtime-local.ps1
