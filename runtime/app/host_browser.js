/**
 * host_browser.js — the one seam where the runtime borrows a browser view an MCP
 * client already owns, instead of launching its own Chromium.
 *
 * Today the only such client is Conxa Execute: it renders skill runs inside its own
 * window (a "cowork" panel) rather than letting a separate Chromium window pop up.
 * Execute passes two things as environment variables when it spawns the runtime
 * (see conxa-execute/app/electron/mcp_client.js):
 *   - CONXA_HOST_BROWSER_CDP   the Chrome DevTools Protocol endpoint of its own
 *                              Electron process (chromium.connectOverCDP target)
 *   - CONXA_HOST_CONTROL_URL   a loopback HTTP control channel Execute runs, used to
 *                              ask it to create a WebContentsView (new_view/new_tab, with an
 *                              optional tab label) and destroy one (close_view — a single tab,
 *                              e.g. a finished login) or a whole run's worth (run_end)
 *
 * Every other client (Claude Desktop, the scheduler, the Build Studio sandbox) never
 * sets these, so endpoint() returns null and browser.js's existing chromium.launch()
 * path is exercised exactly as before — this module is inert for them.
 *
 * Electron's CDP target does NOT support Target.createBrowserContext or
 * Target.createTarget (confirmed by a Stage-0 spike against Electron 42 / Playwright
 * 1.59) — there is exactly one browser context (browser.contexts()[0]), and a new
 * page can only come from Execute itself creating a WebContentsView. That shapes
 * every function below: acquire() takes the existing context and asks Execute for a
 * page rather than creating one, and newTab() is a control-channel round trip, not a
 * context.newPage() call.
