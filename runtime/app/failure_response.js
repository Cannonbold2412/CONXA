/**
 * failure_response.js — assembly of the MCP failure response payloads, extracted
 * from server.js so the LLM prompt-engineering text (the agent recovery request)
 * is unit-testable without loading the whole server.
 *
 * Two shapes, decided by the recovery-tier ceiling (CONXA_MAX_RECOVERY_TIER):
 *   • ceiling 2 (Build Studio): a concise, deterministic failure. No agent
 *     handoff, no screenshots — the compiled pack is judged on its T1/T2 merits.
 *   • ceiling ≥ 3: the ARMED agent round — a browser-use-style ranked, indexed
 *     candidate digest of the live page, plus CUA-style visual grounding (the
 *     failure screenshot, the pre-step screenshot, and the recording-time
 *     reference image when it is actually present on disk). The client nominates
 *     a candidate_index (reflection contract) or a selector, and the runtime
 *     re-verifies that pick against a uniqueness gate before acting.
 *
 * EVERY round is armed. This replaced a split where round one was text-only and
 * screenshots were withheld for a separate later round — a token-cost lever that
 * inverted the priority. The first round is the likeliest to succeed, so it is
 * the one that should be best armed; withholding saved tokens on the attempts
 * that were going to work anyway and cost a whole wasted round-trip (the entire
 * digest re-sent) on the ones that actually needed the pictures. Ceiling 3 and 4
 * now behave identically; ceiling 2 is unchanged.
 *
 * Everything that used to be a server.js module-level binding arrives via `deps`,
 * evaluated at call time (server.js binds some of them late inside its SDK try block).
