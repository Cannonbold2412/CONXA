//   judge      — the active check: re-request the login URL and see if it still shows a login form.
//   baseline   — a GENUINE signed-out snapshot of the login URL (fresh, cookie-less context),
//                used by pre-flight validation and the prover instead of any host/redirect
//                matching (see browser.js::_signedOutBaseline, isSignedInAgainstBaseline below).
//   timekeeper — wait for the ticket signature to stop changing before saving (see browser.js).

//
// A snapshot "looks like a login answer" when it has a login-shaped path (LOGIN_PATH_RE — a
// generic pattern, not a per-company list) or still shows a password box. Either means "not
// signed in, as far as this probe can tell". Deliberately has no notion of "known identity
// provider hosts": that list was both incomplete (couldn't know every SSO/OAuth provider a
// customer's stack might use) and wrong when an app IS its own sign-in host under a name that
// happens to match a general-purpose provider's own domain (e.g. github.com — GitHub is often
// the app itself, not a third party fronting one). The signed-out baseline compare below
// (isSignedInAgainstBaseline) is what replaced host-list reasoning; this function only classifies
// ONE snapshot in isolation, generically.
// A whole path segment at ANY depth, not just the first: Google's signed-out pages live under
