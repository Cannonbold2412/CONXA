// PROD-3 (EXEC-24 P5) — the line for a destructive step is RE-IDENTIFICATION, not tier.
//
// A `step.destructive === true` step may retry the SAME element under different timing or a
// narrower scope, but must never be re-resolved to a different one. So it runs Layer 1 AND the
// same-element half of Layer 2 (transient retry, re-hover, dialog scope — all of which re-try
// `primarySelector` itself), while `recoverWithA11y` — the one stage that re-probes by accessible
// name and can therefore land on a different node — stays blocked.
//
// This replaced a blanket halt before all of Layer 2. That halt was correct when Layer 2 still
// contained a fallback-selector walk and a fuzzy text match (both picked a different element by
// text affinity and clicked `.first()`); once those were deleted, blocking the remaining
// same-selector stages while still allowing L1's identical same-selector retry was an accident of
// where the gate sat, not a safety property.
