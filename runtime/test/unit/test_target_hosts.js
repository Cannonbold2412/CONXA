// Platform-tag / multi-host lock keying: a group workflow that starts in one app
// and links into a sibling mid-recording (e.g. "Deploy a Service on Render then
// Visit frontend on Vercel") must resolve to EVERY app in its group, so a
// sibling run overlapping ANY of those hosts serializes against it while runs on
// disjoint platforms stay parallel. Proves resolveTargetHosts (extracted from
// server.js) computes that union — a group is the unit of sign-in, so it is also
// the unit of locking. See conxa Workflow.visited_hosts for the Studio-side twin.
