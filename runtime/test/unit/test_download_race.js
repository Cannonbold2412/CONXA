// download_observed handler used to check the queue exactly once and bail silently if it was
// still empty, so a download that simply hadn't started yet looked identical to "no download
// happened at all": downloaded_file/downloaded_file_dir never got bound, and a later upload step
// bound to {{downloaded_file_dir}} failed with a "no file path" error that had nothing to do with
// a missing input. The handler must wait for an entry to arrive, not just glance at the queue.
