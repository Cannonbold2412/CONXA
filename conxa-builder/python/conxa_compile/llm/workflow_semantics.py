"""Validation for the second-opinion section of the merged workflow-review
call (BUILD-25): decides the four things no per-step rule can decide
correctly, because the information they need is workflow-global.

`_validate_findings` here used to gate a standalone workflow_semantics LLM
call. It's now reused by workflow_review.py, which merges that call with the
workflow-intent call into one whole-workflow multimodal call — see
workflow_review.py's module docstring.

This module only DECIDES. compiler/second_opinion.py writes the decisions onto
the compiled steps, so a reviewer opening Human Review sees finished work
rather than a list of chips to approve — Human Review is the gate, and a wrong
call is edited there like any other compiler output.

That means the output of this call is applied, not annotated, and the six
validation gates in _validate_findings below are the trust boundary between an
LLM and a shipped artifact. They matter more now, not less: keep every one of
them. Precision over recall — a pass that always finds something is worse than
one that usually finds nothing, because "no findings" is a first-class and
expected outcome.

CLAUDE.md's "LLM does not write selector strings on the primary compile path"
invariant holds: nothing here or in the applier touches a selector, an identity
signal, or an element address. It writes meaning only — binding names, value
placeholders, phase, optionality.

workflow_review.py mirrors the old cache-lookup -> LLM call -> validate ->
cache-on-success-only shape (never on empty, so a drained provider pool
retries next compile). Never raises. A failed or disabled call falls back to
the rules-only compile, which is a different (rules-only) package, not the
same one — see TODO.md BUILD-25 for why that trade was taken.

Six kinds (BUILD-25's six problem families):
  - rename_binding / parameterize_literal — naming is workflow-global; two
    same-typed fields can only be told apart with the whole workflow in view.
  - suggest_optional — the recorder already flags a step optional_hint
    (stochastic across recordings); this only judges hints that already exist,
    it never invents one.
  - label_phase — labels a run of steps login/navigate/act/verify/cleanup.
    Read by runtime/app/failure_response.js's Tier B recovery prompt
    (BUILD-25 stage e); deliberately distinct from the riskier group_steps
    kind, which is out of scope here.
  - suggest_assertion (stage d) — a step's real post-condition is only
    visible from a later step. Advisory only (required=False, always) and
    restricted to text/URL/state assertion types — never a selector type,
    since that target is a raw Playwright selector and this pass may never
    write one (CLAUDE.md's selector-string invariant, not just the
    "never touches validation" one it also narrows).
  - flag_noise (stage d) — a step the recorder itself observed to have no
    effect (post_condition.classified_effect == "none"), never the model's
    own opinion alone. Applied as an archive, not a silent delete: see
    compiler/second_opinion.py::archive_flagged_steps.

Findings are keyed on step_key (compiler/step_key.py), never step_index — an
inserted step renumbers everything after it (BUILD-22/BUILD-23).
