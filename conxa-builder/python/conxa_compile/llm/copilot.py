"""Studio-side client for the Human Review Copilot's diagnosis-and-repair task (BUILD-26 stage b).

One call per conversation turn — there is no multi-turn *session* on this call path
(`ProxyBody` carries no `messages` field — every task builds a fresh `[system, user]` pair per
call), so the whole conversation lives in the renderer and is flattened into one payload each
turn; this module stays stateless either way. Two LLM calls make up one turn (BUILD-26 stage c):
a streamed `copilot_reply` call for the prose the reviewer reads live, and the existing
`copilot_diagnose` call for proposals — kept as two calls, not one, because `copilot_diagnose`'s
JSON-object contract can't be streamed cleanly (see `conxa_core.llm.client`'s `copilot_reply` and
`copilot_diagnose` branches for both prompts).

BUILD-26 stage g adds two things to the `copilot_diagnose` side only (never to the streamed
`copilot_reply`, which stays prose-only so the reviewer sees text immediately):
  - the capability manifest (`editor/capability_manifest.py`) and a workflow DIGEST
    (`evidence.py`'s `detail="digest"`) replace the old always-full evidence dump, so the model
    knows what the runtime can execute and sees every step, but not every step's heavy fields;
  - a bounded `need[]` retrieval loop — the model asks for detail (`editor/copilot_retrieval.py`)
    instead of receiving it all up front, capped at `MAX_RETRIEVAL_ROUNDS` extra calls per turn.
