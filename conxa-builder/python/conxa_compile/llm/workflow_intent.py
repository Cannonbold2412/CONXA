"""Parsing for the workflow-intent section of the merged workflow-review call.

`_graph_from_raw` used to belong to a standalone workflow-intent LLM call that
ran before the per-step compile loop. It's now reused by workflow_review.py,
which merges that call with the second-opinion pass into one whole-workflow
multimodal call that runs after every step (and its vision anchor) is
compiled — see workflow_review.py's module docstring for why.

This is one of the few LLM-driven passes the compile pipeline still runs — see
the "LLM does not write selector strings" invariant; it produces intents and
annotations, never selectors.
