"""Generic compile-time "ask an LLM to rewrite this into friendlier copy" helper.

Every advisory, non-primary LLM call whose only job is turning something the compiler
already decided deterministically into better prose for a human reviewer — never a
decision-maker, never allowed to change what actually got compiled — should call this
instead of hand-rolling its own cache + fallback + failure-logging dance.
`llm/loop_suggestion_copy.py` is the first caller, not a special case: it existed as a
bespoke module before this was pulled out, mirroring the same duplication llm_cache.py's
own docstring describes ("every task client under conxa_compile/llm/ has hand-rolled the
identical dual-write cache... this extracts that one pattern").

Every task built to go through here must have a client.py branch whose system prompt asks
for strict JSON `{"text": "..."}` — this helper only ever reads that one key.
