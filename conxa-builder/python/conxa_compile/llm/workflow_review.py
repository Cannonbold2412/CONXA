"""Merged workflow-intent + second-opinion LLM call (BUILD-26).

Used to be two whole-workflow text-only calls: workflow_intent.py (goal +
per-step intent, ran before the per-step compile loop) and
workflow_semantics.py (BUILD-25's second opinion, ran after every step was
compiled). Both were deliberately fed tiny payloads — no DOM, no screenshots,
truncated text — a cost/latency choice, not a quality one.

This module merges them into one multimodal call that runs where the old
second-opinion call did (after every step, including its vision anchor, is
compiled), so it can see the full compiled context AND, per step, the
screenshot the vision-anchor stage already chose as the click target —
compiler/build.py builds that image side-map while step/event alignment still
holds and threads it in by step_key. See compiler/build.py's
`_review_inputs`/`_apply_workflow_review_to_steps` for how the request is
built and the response applied.

Consequence of merging: the intent graph (goal, per-step semantic_description,
SkillPackage.intent_graph) is no longer available before the per-step build
loop runs. Vision-anchor selection and each step's `intent` field fall back to
the recorder's own heuristic (normalize_compiler_intent's content-derived
path) instead of an LLM-resolved token — build.py backfills `step.intent` from
this call's result afterward where the heuristic left it blank/generic, but
the anchor-selection prompt has already run by then; that quality loss is real
and not recovered.

Both original modules' parsing/validation are reused unchanged:
workflow_intent.py's `_graph_from_raw` for the goal/steps/decision_points
section, workflow_semantics.py's `_validate_findings` for the suggestions
section — only the orchestration (one call instead of two) is new.

llm_semantic_suggestions_enabled gates only the `suggestions` section, exactly
as it gated the old standalone second-opinion call — the intent graph still
generates unconditionally, matching its old ungated behavior. A failure/empty
response degrades the whole thing to (WorkflowIntentGraph(), []) — the
rules-only compile — never raises.
