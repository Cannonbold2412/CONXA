"""Invoke a tool on the installed Conxa MCP runtime over stdio JSON-RPC.

Split out of conxa_runtime.py: this half spawns the runtime executable as a
subprocess and drives its stdio MCP protocol. Depends on conxa_runtime.py
for runtime-directory resolution (RuntimeToolError, _runtime_exe); nothing
in conxa_runtime.py calls back into this.

The runtime process is cached and reused across calls (keyed by exe + CONXA_DIR)
instead of being spawned fresh every time — see the module-level `_cache` below.
The runtime app itself is built for a long-lived process (run registry, host
locks, its own browser-instance cache all assume many execute_skill calls over
one process lifetime, exactly how a real MCP client uses it); spawning fresh per
call was paying a ~35s cold-start + MCP handshake penalty on every single Build
Studio "Run Test" click for no reason.

    The underlying runtime process is cached per (exe, CONXA_DIR) and reused across
    calls — see `_cache` above — so a caller making a single call sees identical
    behavior to before (cold spawn, one `initialize`, one `tools/call`), while a
    caller that calls again shortly after skips straight to `tools/call` on the
    already-running, already-initialized process. An idle process is torn down
    after `_IDLE_TIMEOUT_S` with no in-flight calls; a dead/crashed cached process
    is detected and replaced transparently on the next call.

    ``conxa_dir`` is CONXA_DIR for the spawned process — in Dev this is the same
    locally-built dev-runtime/ folder as ``runtime_dir`` (resolve_dev_runtime_dir());
    in Production it's the customer-faithful staged sandbox.

    ``CONXA_APP_DIR`` IS explicitly injected (derived from ``conxa_dir``), even
    though runtime/env.js would derive the same value on its own when unset. It
    can't be left unset here: when Build Studio itself was launched via
    scripts/conxa.ps1, CONXA_APP_DIR is already present in os.environ (pointing
    at ~/.conxa-dev/conxa-app), and proc_env inherits from os.environ — so an
    omitted override lets that stale value leak through and beat env.js's
    from-CONXA_DIR derivation, sending bootstrap.js looking in the wrong place.

    ``phase_sink``, if given, is called live (from the stderr-reader thread, so
    it must be thread-safe) with each ``test_phase`` diagnostic entry the runtime
    logs via server.js's ``log()`` — host-lock wait, the two sequential Chromium
    launches inside getCachedBrowser, and time-to-first-step. Lets a slow "Run
    Test" click be broken down into real numbers instead of one opaque wait.
