"""Deterministic detection of a single-file download->upload pattern that could generalize into
a `for_each` loop over a caller-supplied list of files.

No LLM involved anywhere in this module — the decision to propose is a pure structural pattern
match over facts the compiler already computes (`upload_binding.py`'s single-download binding,
a literal filename appearing verbatim in an earlier `navigate` step's URL). This is deliberately
narrower than the general "was this clicked element part of a list" question: it only ever
proposes generalizing a URL literal, never invents or touches a selector, matching (more
conservatively than) BUILD-26's own rule that a Human Review suggestion may never invent a
selector for something never observed (see docs/TRD.md).

Findings are advisory only, stored under compile_report["for_each_suggestions"] — nothing here
mutates a step. Applying one is `editor/workflow_mutations.py::apply_for_each_loop_suggestion`,
gated behind an explicit Human Edit "Accept" click (`handlers/copilot.py`), same governance model
as BUILD-25's second-opinion findings and BUILD-26's Copilot proposals.

    substring check against the recorded (decoded) filename silently misses every filename
    containing such a character (+, space, non-ASCII, ...) — this bit the very first real
    filename that had one. Decoding the URL, rather than re-encoding the filename, is the
    correct direction: percent-encoding is ambiguous going the other way (a space can become
    "%20" or "+" depending on context/site) but %XX decoding is not. Shared by both the
    detector below and `editor/workflow_mutations.py::apply_for_each_loop_suggestion`, which

    The returned URL is intentionally the DECODED form (e.g. a literal "+" rather than "%2B").
    This loses nothing at replay: `runtime/app/handlers.js`'s navigate handler hands the URL
    straight to Playwright's `page.goto()`, which accepts unencoded reserved characters in a
