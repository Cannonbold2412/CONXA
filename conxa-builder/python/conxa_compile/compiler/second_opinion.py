"""Apply the second-opinion pass's findings to the compiled steps (BUILD-25).

The pass (llm/workflow_semantics.py) looks at the whole workflow at once and
decides four things no per-step rule can decide correctly. This module is what
writes those decisions into the steps, so a reviewer opening Human Review sees
finished work rather than a list of chips to approve.

  rename_binding        {{email_2}}          -> {{sender_email}}
  parameterize_literal  "INV-2024-0891"      -> {{reference_number}}
  label_phase           step.phase           -> login|navigate|act|verify|cleanup
  suggest_optional      a required step      -> a try_dismiss branch
  suggest_assertion     (nothing)            -> an advisory validation.assertions entry
  flag_noise            a no-op step         -> removed from `steps`, archived (see below)

What this module deliberately does NOT touch: selectors, identity bundles,
compiled_selectors, wait_for/success_conditions, frame/tab chains, or anything
else describing *how* an element is found. CLAUDE.md's "LLM does not write
selector strings on the primary compile path" invariant is intact —
suggest_assertion may only append a text/URL/state Assertion (never a
selector-bearing type) and always forces required=False, so a wrong one can
never halt a run. flag_noise is the pass's one destructive kind; see
archive_flagged_steps below for why it archives rather than deletes.

Human Review is the gate. Every field written here is one a reviewer can edit
in Human Edit, and nothing marks it as machine-written — an applied rename is
indistinguishable from one the fixed rules produced, by design.

Applying `suggest_optional` at compile time retires the older "branch steps
compile only from observed states + human confirmation" rule: the hint is still
an observed state (the recorder saw the step behave non-deterministically), but
the confirmation is now after the fact, in Human Review, instead of before.
editor/workflow_mutations.py::confirm_optional_interstitial remains for hints
this pass left alone, and shares build_try_dismiss_from_hint below so the two
paths cannot drift.
