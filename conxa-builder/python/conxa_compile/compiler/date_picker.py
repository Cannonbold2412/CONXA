"""Collapse a custom-calendar click run into one parameterized date_pick step.

Native `<input type=date|datetime-local|time|month|week>` never reaches this module — those
compile as an ordinary `date_pick` action straight from the recorder's "change" listener
(bridge.js) and already carry a real value and a durable identity_bundle. This module only
handles the OTHER kind of date picker: a custom calendar widget (MUI, react-datepicker,
flatpickr, Ant Design, jQuery UI, ...) that records as several unrelated `click` steps — open
the field, "next month" x N, day cell — each tagged with `date_context` by
bridge.js::buildDateContext. Left alone, that run is unreplayable: the month-nav count is frozen
to whatever the recording needed that day, and the day-cell text ("15") is ambiguous against the
greyed overflow days from the adjacent month. See CLAUDE.md's date-picker plan for the full
design.

Runs as a post-pass over the already-built SkillStep list, modelled on
upload_binding.apply_bindings_to_compiled_steps: it needs steps[i] aligned 1:1 with events[i],
which only holds up to the point build.py calls this (right after _populate_hover_chains, before
_insert_start_navigate_step prepends a synthetic step with no matching event).

    Selector identity, not is_editable_target(ev): the opener may be a non-form element (a

    `field_selector` comes from bridge.js's `_selectorForElement` (buildStableSelector first,
