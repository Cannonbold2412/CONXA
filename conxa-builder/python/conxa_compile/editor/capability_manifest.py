"""The Human Review Copilot's ground-truth statement of what it may propose and what the runtime
actually does with a step (BUILD-26 stage g — "the copilot doesn't know what the runtime can do").

Generated from the SAME data structures the editor's own patch gate enforces
(`editor/patch_gate.py`'s `*_ALLOWED_KEYS` constants and `editor/action_registry.py`'s
kind/category/insertable/selector/value sets) rather than hand-duplicated prose — the failure
mode this exists to prevent is the manifest telling the model something is allowed that the gate
then silently drops, wasting the reviewer's turn. The only hand-maintained content is
`RUNTIME_NOTES`: one line per kind naming what `runtime/app/*` actually requires or ignores for
it (see docs/TRD.md's runtime dispatch table) — prose the gate has no way to derive, since the
gate enforces the editor's contract, not the runtime's.
