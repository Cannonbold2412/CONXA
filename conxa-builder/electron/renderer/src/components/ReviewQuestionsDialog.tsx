// ── Generic review-question chain ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// One pending decision (a suggestion, a flagged step, …) can need more than one dependent
// Yes/No answer before it's actually applied — e.g. "turn this into a loop?" and, only if
// that was Yes, a separate "remove the leftover click too?" — while still landing as ONE
// atomic backend write. Rather than hard-code that two-question shape into the dialog (which
// would leave the NEXT compound suggestion re-inventing the same bookkeeping), a `ReviewItem`
// is anything that can be asked as a chain of Yes/No questions: `nextQuestion` looks at every
// answer collected so far and returns the next question to ask, or `null` once nothing more
// is needed; `commit` then performs the one real mutation. The dialog below only ever drives
// this contract — it has no idea what a "loop" or a "redundant click" is.
