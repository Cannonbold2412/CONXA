/**
 * Plain-English copy for backend error codes.
 *
 * The Python backend raises `_CommandError(code, message)`; the `code` is a
 * stable machine string (e.g. `cloud_unreachable`) while `message` is sometimes
 * a raw exception string that is unhelpful to end users. This map lets the UI
 * render a friendly, actionable sentence keyed on the code, and fall back to the
 * backend message only when a code is unmapped.
 *
 * Keep this in sync with the `_CommandError(...)` call sites in
 * `conxa-builder/python/backend.py`, the entitlement copy in
 * `backend.py:_entitlement_error_message`, and the patch-validation codes raised as
 * `ValueError`s from `conxa_compile/editor/patch_gate.py` (surfaced by `cmd_patch_step` as
 * `_CommandError(str(exc), "Patch rejected: <exc>")` — the code IS the raw ValueError string).
 * Codes with a dynamic index in their name (e.g. `frame_chain_0_selector_required`,
 * `branch_option_2_must_be_object`) aren't enumerated here — those UI surfaces (frame chain
 * editing, wait_for_one_of options) have no editor yet, so the raw code reaching a toast isn't
 * reachable in practice today. Add a mapping if/when that gap is closed.
